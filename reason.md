## Reason

I always liked [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/J1svNp7.jpg) and felt that Golang
has one of the lowest WTFs/minute when reading code. And I really liked the
point in [this article](https://npf.io/2017/03/3.5yrs-500k-lines-of-
go/#generics), "I don’t remember ever doing a code review and wishing for
generics for someone else’s code".

But that forms an assertion that can be tested, hence the original criteria,
"find examples in public repos of code other people wrote that you think could
be improved by generics and provide some examples of what you think they would
have written."

My interest in the topic is less about whether Go ever implements generics and
more about finding common ground for the community. Both sides raise good
issues, but there is no consensus. Perhaps by looking at the problems that arise
in production code we can build a repertoire of problems. And this is what the
Go leadership has asked for. Given a good sample set, I think we can find a set
of solutions that most of the community will be happy with.
